    description: "Hi! My name is Alyssa, I've had a passion for baking since I was 10 years old. I attened Johnson & Wales University for baking and pasty arts. My love for baking started through watching cake boss and ace of cakes. However it wasn't until recently I started my own bakery buisness. I began doing this as a hobby, but then decided to pursue it professionally because I've always wanted to start my own buisness but never knew how. This year has been a crazy year and I didn't want to give up on a dream of mine and now I have consistent growth and always have a new cake to work on. I am glad I decided to go for it.",
